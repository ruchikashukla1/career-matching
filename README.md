# Motivation: As job applicants, we have all applied to thousands of jobs, and ended up getting only a few iterviews. With the rise in AI Tools, applicants per job have skyrocketed, career coaches on TikTok and LinkedIn have left Recruiter's feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of messages, emails and applications. This is in bad taste for both the parties - the applicants and the recruiters. Our tool provides recruiters to screen resumes not just using blackbox ATS but gives an explanation of why a candidate was selected, what is their career trajectory (there is a weighting internally on these 2) and provides with a matching score to rank the candidates.
### Components:

#### 1. Data Ingestor: Amalgamates all data sources and generates a weighted embedding representation for 2 aspects - career trajectory and requirements.
